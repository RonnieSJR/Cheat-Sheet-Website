## Overview

This documentation provides an overview of the Frontend Development Cheat Sheet project, its architecture, and key components.

## Architecture

The project follows a client-server architecture:

1. Client-side: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files served statically
2. Server-side: Express.js server for routing and serving static files

## Key Components

1. **Client-side**

   - `index.html`: Main entry point for the web application
   - `main.css`: Styles for the entire application
   - `main.js`: JavaScript for dynamic content loading and interactivity

2. **Server-side**
   - `server.js`: Express.js server for routing and serving static files

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Development: Nodemon for hot-reloading during development
